# Local Multiplayer Game Server

This project is a lightweight, self-hosted web server for playing classic multiplayer games over a local network or via P2P.

## Setup

1.  **Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js installed on the machine that will act as the server.
2.  **Clone Repository:** Download or clone this repository to your machine.

## Installation

1.  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `game-server` root directory.
2.  Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Server

1.  Once the installation is complete, run the following command to start the server:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
2.  The server will now be running. You can access the game hub by opening a web browser and going to `http://[SERVER-IP-ADDRESS]:8081`. You can find your server's local IP address in your network settings. If you are on the server machine itself, you can use `http://localhost:8081`.
